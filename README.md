**Introduction**
The objective of this project was to preprocess raw data, including cleaning and merging it into a usable format, and then to create an interactive Tableau dashboard for insightful visualizations. The project focuses on improving data accessibility and enabling data-driven decision-making.

**Technologies Used**
**Python:** Data cleaning and merging (Pandas, NumPy)
**Tableau:** Dashboard creation and data visualization

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project consisted of multiple files that required cleaning and merging to form a consolidated dataset. It included various columns with missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting, all of which were handled in the data preprocessing stage.

**Data Cleaning and Merging**
The following steps were performed in Python to clean and merge the dataset:

**Handled missing values:** Imputed or removed missing data based on relevance.
**Removed duplicates:** Ensured data integrity by eliminating duplicate records.
**Standardized formats:** Corrected inconsistent date and text formats.
**Merged datasets:** Joined multiple datasets into a single dataframe using keys.

**Tableau Dashboard**
The cleaned and merged dataset was imported into Tableau to create a dashboard with the following features:

**Interactive filters:** Allow users to filter data by different attributes.
**Charts and Graphs:** Bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts were used to represent key insights.
**KPIs:** Key performance indicators were highlighted to summarize important metrics.
